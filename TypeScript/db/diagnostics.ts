// In this example we are showing how to properly use pg-monitor to log
// errors in a DEV and PROD environments.

// As an alternative for a PROD environment, instead of using pg-monitor
// you could handle event 'error' within initialization options yourself,
// which may be a little better performing, but lacks all the nice formatting
// provided by pg-monitor.

import os = require('os');
import fs = require('fs');
import * as pgMonitor from 'pg-monitor';

pgMonitor.setTheme('matrix'); // changing the default theme;

// Flag to indicate whether we are in a DEV environment:
var $DEV = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

// Log file for database-related errors:
var logFile = './db/errors.log';

// Below we are logging errors exactly the way they are reported by pg-monitor,
// which you can tweak any way you like, as parameter 'info' provides all the
// necessary details for that.
//
// see: https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-monitor#log
pgMonitor.log = (msg, info) => {

    // In a PROD environment we will only receive event 'error',
    // because this is how we set it up below.

    // And the check below is for DEV environment only, as we want to log
    // errors only, or else the file will grow out of proportion in no time.

    if (info.event === 'error') {

        var logText = os.EOL + msg; // line break + next error message;

        if (info.time) {
            // If it is a new error being reported,
            // and not an additional error line;
            logText = os.EOL + logText; // add another line break in front;
        }

        fs.appendFileSync(logFile, logText); // add error handling as required;
    }

    // We absolutely must not let the monitor write anything into the console
    // while in a PROD environment, and not just because nobody will be able
    // to see it there, but mainly because the console is incredibly slow and
    // hugely resource-consuming, suitable only for debugging.

    if (!$DEV) {

        // If it is not a DEV environment:

        info.display = false; // display nothing;
    }

};

var attached = false;

export = {

    // Monitor initialization function;
    init: (options:any) => {

        // We are checking to avoid calling 'attach' more than once,
        // without calling 'detach', as it will throw an error;

        if (attached) {
            return; // shouldn't call it more than once;
        }
        attached = true;

        if ($DEV) {

            // In a DEV environment, we attach to all supported events:

            pgMonitor.attach(options);

        } else {

            // In a PROD environment we should only attach to the type of events
            // that we intend to log. And we are only logging event 'error' here:

            pgMonitor.attach(options, ['error']);
        }
    },

    // This is one method that in practice we never really need. It is
    // here just to show that it is possible, in case it is ever needed.
    done: () => {
        if (attached) {
            attached = false;
            pgMonitor.detach(); // detach from all the events;
